# lz-string-vbnet
VB.NET implementation of the [lz-string](https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string) JavaScript library

## Notes
This is a port of version 1.4.1 of the [lz-string](https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string) JavaScript library to VB.NET.

At the time this was created, the C# port ([lz-string-csharp](https://github.com/jawa-the-hutt/lz-string-csharp)) was occassionally giving incorrect outputs. My goal was to exactly match the outputs coming from the original lz-string. The port reflects that, with the code being nearly identical to the original implementation.
